# Introduction to dplyr

In this class, we will explore the **dplyr** package for data manipulation in R. You will learn how to use its key functions such as `select()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`, and `mutate()`. We will also cover advanced topics like using `across()` for applying functions to multiple columns, grouping and summarizing data, and joining datasets.

---

## Loading Libraries and Dataset

We begin by loading the **tidyverse** package (which includes dplyr) and using the built-in **mtcars** dataset.  
If you haven't installed **tidyverse**, run:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Now, load the library and view the first few rows of the dataset:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
head(mtcars)
```

## Part 1: Selecting and Renaming Columns

### 1.1 Select Specific Columns

The `select()` function extracts specific columns from a dataset. For example, to select only `mpg`, `hp`, and `cyl`:

```{r}
mtcars_selected <- mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, hp, cyl)
head(mtcars_selected)
```

**Task 1:**  
*Exercise: Select columns `wt`, `qsec`, and `gear` from the mtcars dataset.*

```{r}
# Your code here
```

### 1.2 Renaming Columns

Use `rename()` to change column names without altering the data structure. For example, to rename `mpg` to `Miles_Per_Gallon`:

```{r}
mtcars_renamed <- mtcars %>%
  rename(Miles_Per_Gallon = mpg)
head(mtcars_renamed)
```

**Task 2:**  
*Exercise: Rename the `hp` column to `Horsepower`.*

```{r}
# Your code here
```

---

## Part 2: Filtering Rows

### 2.1 Filter Based on One Condition

Use `filter()` to select rows meeting a condition. For example, filtering cars with more than 6 cylinders:

```{r}
mtcars_filtered <- mtcars %>%
  filter(cyl > 6)
head(mtcars_filtered)
```

### 2.2 Filter Based on Multiple Conditions

Combine conditions using logical operators (`&` for AND, `|` for OR). For example, filtering cars with more than 6 cylinders and more than 100 horsepower:

```{r}
mtcars_filtered_advanced <- mtcars %>%
  filter(cyl > 6 & hp > 100)
head(mtcars_filtered_advanced)
```

**Task 3:**  
*Exercise: Filter cars that have either 4 or 8 cylinders.*

```{r}
# Your code here
```

---

## Part 3: Creating New Variables with mutate()

### 3.1 Basic Mutate

The `mutate()` function creates or modifies columns. For example, to create a new column representing horsepower per weight:

```{r}
mtcars_new_var <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(hp_per_wt = hp / wt)
head(mtcars_new_var)
```

### 3.2 Creating Multiple New Columns

You can create multiple columns in one go. For example, add `hp_per_wt` and a scaled version of `mpg`:

```{r}
mtcars_multi_mutate <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(hp_per_wt = hp / wt,
         scaled_mpg = scale(mpg))
head(mtcars_multi_mutate)
```

### 3.3 Conditional Mutate

Create new columns based on conditions using `if_else()`. For example, classify cars as "High HP" or "Low HP":

```{r}
mtcars_classified <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(hp_class = if_else(hp > 150, "High HP", "Low HP"))
head(mtcars_classified)
```

**Task 4:**  
*Exercise: Create a new variable classifying cars as "Heavy" or "Light" based on their weight (`wt`).*

```{r}
# Your code here
```

### 3.4 Advanced: Using case_when()

Use `case_when()` for multiple conditions. For example, classify cars into weight categories:

```{r}
mtcars_weight_class <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(weight_class = case_when(
    wt < 2.5 ~ "Light",
    wt >= 2.5 & wt < 3.5 ~ "Medium",
    wt >= 3.5 ~ "Heavy"
  ))
head(mtcars_weight_class)
```

### 3.5 Using mutate() with across()

Apply the same transformation to multiple columns using `across()`. For example, standardize the `mpg` and `hp` columns:

```{r}
mtcars_scaled_vars <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(across(c(mpg, hp), scale))
head(mtcars_scaled_vars)
```

---

## Part 4: Sorting and Arranging Data

Use the `arrange()` function to sort your data. For example, to sort by `mpg` in ascending order:

```{r}
mtcars_sorted <- mtcars %>%
  arrange(mpg)
head(mtcars_sorted)
```

**Task 5:**  
*Exercise: Arrange the cars by horsepower (`hp`) in descending order.*

```{r}
mtcars_sorted_desc <- mtcars %>%
  arrange(desc(hp))
head(mtcars_sorted_desc)
```


---

## Part 5: Joining Data

Sometimes you'll need to combine data from two sources. dplyr offers functions like `left_join()`, `inner_join()`, etc. For example, suppose we have another dataset:

```{r}
# Create a simple data frame with car models and a new variable
car_info <- tibble(
  model = rownames(mtcars),
  origin = rep(c("USA", "Europe", "Japan"), length.out = nrow(mtcars))
)

# Join mtcars with car_info by converting row names to a column
mtcars_joined <- mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "model") %>%
  left_join(car_info, by = "model")
head(mtcars_joined)
```

*Tip:* Use `left_join()` when you want to keep all observations from your main dataset.

## Part 7: Exercises and Further Exploration

Now it's your turn! Try writing your own dplyr code:
- Experiment with different filtering conditions.
- Create new variables based on your own criteria.
- Explore additional joins such as `right_join()` or `full_join()` with custom datasets.

```{r}
# Your exercise code here
```
